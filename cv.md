**My state and goal:**  
    I started my programming path by learning Python, later I decided to switch to Front-End Development, as it suits me more as a 'like to paint' person.Before that graduated art school.  
    I haven't worked anywhere yet, but I can adapt pretty fast and my goal is to work as a Front-End Developer.
